Parallax effect


---
Hero section with parallax effect plus some animation on the other paragraphs
There is no need any plugin or other code from third party. Just pure HTML + CSS + JavaScript.

Just like other parallax effect, this is working with the scroll. There is a nice hero section and when you scroll down in the window, it will goes up but the different elements moving different speed. At the end it gives a nice result.

This is with cloudy mountain image background with some transparent cloud image, but it can be nice with other desig as well.

There is some **HTML** `data` option to controll the effect:

* **data-rateX**: controll the movement speed horizontally
* **data-rateY**: controll the movement speed verticaly
* **data-dir**: this give the direction for the movement

CSS variables:
there is no **SCSS** just a plain **CSS** but I use some variable

* **--font-header**:  is the size of the header text
* **--font-subtext**: is the size of the sub header texxt
* **--header-font-color**: is the color of the header element
